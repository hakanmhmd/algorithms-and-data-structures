/**
 * There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days.
 * In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.

 Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the
 flower will open in that day.

 For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where
 i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.

 Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming,
 and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.

 If there isn't such day, output -1.
